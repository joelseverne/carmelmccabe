      <h2 class="blogTitle">All You Need is Love!</h2>

      <img class="img1" src="imgs/blog/blog1-1.png" alt="Mrs McCabe">

      <p>Hello, howdy and hi!</p>
      <p>
        My name is Carmel Teresa McCabe and
        I am quite frankly OBSESSED with weddings and everything about them!
      </p>
      <p>
        For several years now I have been working in various fields of photography,
        both commercially and personally. Since the planning of my own wedding my
        love of love knows no bounds! I truly feel so privileged and honored to
        share in the joy of so many peoples wedding day. Combining my passion of
        creating beautiful imagery celebrating love!
      </p>

      <p>
        My own wedding journey started when I made the move from the land locked
        village where I grew up down to South wales to study photography. During
        this time I have met some of the most fantastic people, the Welsh really
        do know how to offer a warm welcome! One of these people was my now husband,
        Killian. And after a whirlwind start, 7 years later we are happily married!
      </p>

      </div>

      <p>
        Our engagement was looooong! Close to 3 years in fact! And in those years I
        fully submerged myself in the joys of wedding planning. It was during this
        time that I realised that surely there is nothing better in life than celebrating
        love?! You dare you to try and convince me otherwise! My wedding day was truly
        the happiest and most perfect day of my life and my job allows me to share that
        beautiful feeling with other people over and over again!
      </p>

      <h2 class="blogTitle">My first wedding - Sam & Matt</h2>

      <img class="img1" src="imgs/blog/blog2-1.png" alt="The happy couple">

      <p>
        August marked the 5 year wedding anniversary of Sam & Matt Dabb.
        Friends of mine that entrusted me with the photography of their wedding.
      </p>

      <p>
        To say this was my first wedding is a little bit of a pork pie as I
        used to work as second photographer back in my late teens. This was
        however my first official orchestrated gig, from bridal prep to first dance!
      </p>

      <img class="img1" src="imgs/blog/blog2-2.png" alt="The happy couple">

      <p>
        I had know Sam and Matt for awhile before the wedding having worked with
        them both in my favourite pub and music venue Le Pub in Newport. And their
        wedding was beautiful! So relaxed and colourful (a photographers dream really)
        The weather was perfect and the guests were up for anything. More weddings
        like this please!!
      </p>

      <img class="img1" src="imgs/blog/blog2-3.png" alt="The happy couple">

      <p>
        I have been blessed with trusting and fun loving friends and even to
        this day these are some of my favourite wedding photographs! So many colours!
        It was a Disney lovers dream!
      </p>

      <p>Congratulations Sam & Matt! Hereâ€™s to many more years to come!</p>

        <h2 class="blogTitle">A Surprise Wedding! - Tahnee and Paul</h2>

        <img class="img1" src="imgs/blog/blog3-1.png" alt="The happy couple">

        <p>
          Early September brought a beautiful, fun and quite frankly super
          surprise wedding at the stunning venue of The Globe is Hay on Wye.
          Why was the wedding surprising I hear you ask? Well, I will tell you!
        </p>

        <p>
          After a hazy week away visiting my parents for my birthday during the
          drive home I had a phone call from a previous client of mine needing an
          emergency photographer for a wedding for the very next day! A grand
          total of 15 hours passed and I was at the venue photographing one of
          the cutest countryside weddings ever!
        </p>

        <div class="blogflex">
          <img class="img4" src="imgs/blog/blog3-2.png" alt="The happy couple">
          <img class="img4" src="imgs/blog/blog3-3.png" alt="The happy couple">
          <img class="img4" src="imgs/blog/blog3-4.png" alt="The happy couple">
        </div>

        <p>
          The bride, Tahnee is another friend of mine. An absolutely beautiful
          soul who picked a dress to match by e&w couture, one of my favourite
          local designers. Whilst her sparkly new husband Paul, who is a
          celebrity in the Haiku writing world made the whole room weep during
          his speech.
        </p>

        <img class="img1" src="imgs/blog/blog3-5.png" alt="The happy couple">

        <p>
          The whole day was so filled with love with a smiley, happy ceremony,
          a gorgeous venue and dreamy weather. Having never been to Hay On wye
          before I was eager to explore the village with my couple. We wandered
          around the cute higgledy piggledy streets and as both the bride and
          groom are massive literary lovers we picked one of their favourite
          book shops for a couple of portraits.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>
          I was so happy that I could help out on the day and help elevate any
          wedding day nightmares from happening. Thank you so much guys,
          I loved every minute!
